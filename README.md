# LeetCode Solutions

## Overview

Welcome to my personal repository for solving LeetCode problems. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of the code and concepts I have learned and implemented during my journey to solve various algorithmic challenges on LeetCode. The primary objective of this repository is to keep a record of my problem-solving progress and to have a reference point for future projects.

## Learning Journey

Throughout this journey, I have tackled a wide range of problems that cover fundamental and advanced topics in data structures and algorithms. The key categories covered include:

- **Arrays and Strings:** Solutions to problems involving manipulation, searching, and sorting of arrays and strings.
- **Linked Lists:** Implementation of various operations on singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues:** Using stack and queue data structures to solve problems related to Last In First Out (LIFO) and First In First Out (FIFO) operations.
- **Trees and Graphs:** Solving problems involving tree traversal, graph traversal, shortest path, and more.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Implementing solutions for optimization problems using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Backtracking:** Solutions to problems that require exploring all possible configurations and pruning invalid paths.
- **Recursion:** Utilizing recursive approaches to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.
- **Sorting and Searching:** Implementing various sorting algorithms and efficient searching techniques.
- **Hashing:** Using hash tables to solve problems related to quick lookups and frequency counting.
- **Bit Manipulation:** Solutions that involve operations on binary representations of numbers.

Each section of this repository contains well-documented code examples and explanations for the problems I have solved. The goal is to create a robust and reusable codebase that demonstrates my problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithmic concepts.



Feel free to explore the code, and I hope it serves as a useful reference for anyone looking to understand or revisit algorithmic concepts. If you have any suggestions or improvements, I am open to feedback!
